# Aether

A dangerous drug but incredibly psychoactive drug made by combining the following ingredients:
- Crushed gems (15GP worth)
- Peat
- Pitch
- Poison extracted from lilies

The Aether is then produced in Alchemist's tools. When combined at a mild heat the ingredients create a black tar like substance which burns slowly and can be smoked through a special pipe.  

The smoke produced is oddly opaque and incredibly multicoloured, this bizarre effect is part of the drugs popularity with artists, mages and individuals concerned with the boutique nature of their vices.

### Effects + Usage

Aether while dangerous produces interesting effects when taken. The drug is bought in daily doses and is smoked throughout the day, the high is great but the low is known to kill those without access to a restorative spell such as greater restoration.

##### The High
The high of the drug overlays the users vision with that of the aethereal plane giving them an enhanced ability to sense magic. Some report a shimmer being seen on magical objects if one looks close enough. The drug also has the curious effect of making the user feel almost invulnerable. The users ability to sense magic via Arcana checks is increased by +1 and they gain resistance to fear.

##### The Low
If the drug is not imbibed the next day the user suffers severe headaches and a pervasive pain that echoes to the soul. The user suffers two levels of exhaustion and takes 3d8 poison damage.  

The effects of the low occur every long rest for a week unless the user continues taking the drug, making chances of stopping addiction slim to none without magical assistance.
