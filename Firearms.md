# Arcomechanical Firearms

These devices are rare works of the magical sciences designed by Oshoth and several other BlackHull artificers.

## Firearm Properties

**Fragile:** This weapon is exceptionally fragile and if the user is hit in melee range while holding the weapon it must be re-aligned with an Action or it may not be fired.

**Brutal:** When fired point blank, the force of the full salvo launches the target back 10ft if they fail a DC 14 Strength saving throw.

**Exemplary:** The craftmanship of the weapon is beautiful, giving a +1 bonus to Persuasion when dealing with commoners.

**Reload X:** When the weapon fires X amount of ammunition, the weapon must be reloaded with an Action.

## Ammunition

Since ammunition must be crafted due to scarcity, the costs of materials needed are listed below.

During a long rest, an individual skilled in Tinker's Tools may make 10 pieces of ammunition. Producing ammunition during a short rest is slower allowing an individual to produce 1d4 pieces.

**Ammunition Materials Cost:** 2gp per piece of ammunition.
