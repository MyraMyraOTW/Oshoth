# Arcomechanical Firearms

These devices are rare works of the magical sciences designed by Oshoth and several other BlackHull artificers.

### Firearm Properties

**Fragile:** This weapon is exceptionally fragile and if the user is hit in melee range while holding the weapon it must be re-aligned with an Action or it may not be fired.

**Brutal:** When fired point blank, the range is reduced to 5ft with no scatter and damage is changed to 2d6 Piercing. The force of the full salvo launches the target back 5ft if they fail a DC 14 Strength saving throw.

**Exemplary:** The craftmanship of the weapon is beautiful, giving a +1 bonus to Persuasion when dealing with commoners.

**Executor:** This weapon is made to remove workers from service, when the target is incapacitated, restrained and the weapon is fired point blank, damage dice are doubled.  


### Longrange Synergistic Optimism Enhancer
