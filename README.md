## Roleplaying

#### Details

Oshoth is a muddy grey kobold with red highlights along the two horns framing striking red eyes and a constant sharp toothed smile. He has a small stature at 2' 3" and dresses in fine functional clothes with nary a spot on them. A curved copper pipe protrudes from his mouth constantly billowing multicoloured smoke.

**Background:** Factory Boss (Professional Psychopath)
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil  
**Eye Colour:** Red  
**Scale Colour:** Muddy Grey w/ Red highlights  
**Age:** 36  
**Height:** 2' 3"  
**Weight:** 28 lbs  

#### Personality Traits

Oshoth has a dangerous personality that is betrayed by his constant smile. He sounds deceptively cheerful at all times, hiding his anger well and showing no signs of outward annoyance. This belies his usually stewing anger that manifests while misleading people and acting contrary to his speech. He is a psychopath while under the effects of [Aether](Aether.md) and a monster when he is off the drug.

#### Bonds

I will demolish those who stand in my way to power.

#### Ideals

Quid Pro Quo is the way this world works, I'll barely lift a finger if the deal isn't fair.

#### Flaws

I am a psychopath, and highly addicted to the substance known as [Aether](Aether.md)

#### Backstory

Oshoth is an unsavory character, working his craft for those who pay his fees and keep his addictions going. Having been dragged into captivity at an early age into the mystical factories of the mysterious BlackHull Shipping Company to service the massive secret arcomechanical devices that make BlackHull a true naval powerhouse. The work was dangerous but still safer than the bosses and other workers, you were either fighting the machines innards or fighting the larger folk for food.  

Oshoth learned alot while huddled in those massive machines, about the way the world worked and how to bend it to his will. His tools were his brushes and those machines his canvas, consistent exemplary work lead to his promotion from indentured servitude to pit boss. Despite his small size Oshoth gave those under his command a reason to fear him, constant productivity increases were expected and he would do anything to meet the quotas, even kill. His knowledge gained from the machines brought him an arcomechanical weapon that acted as a force multiplier for him and his guards.

Oshoth's newfound power brought him many things he never experienced, including the psychedelic magical drug Aether. Aether was made by empowering gems and powdering them with a thick sludge made from swamp peat and a benign poison and provided the user with many effects. Oshoth smoked the drug constantly through his long copper pipe for it heightened his ability to see the magic in the air and produced a sharp high that made you seem indestructible. It did far worse however and made Oshoth dependent on it, making him exhausted when it was taken away. The power was intoxicating for Oshoth, but nothing lasts forever.

A rebellion from the indentured servants caused severe damage to one of the arcane generators that powered the factories. This lead to a wild magic detonation of the plant that had a vast area of effect. The sundered city transformed into a chaotic wasteland of monsters and nonsense. Some would say Oshoth was lucky to have been teleported to another continent, but Oshoth thought otherwise as his race made him an outsider.

Work on the side plying his knowledge of magical machinery for unsavory types kept him functional while topping up his supply of Aether. His preferences always lead him in the wrong direction, but this next job might help turn things around.

#### Allies + Organizations

BlackHull Shipping Company [Old]:  
Served as a Pit Boss for the Company. Worked operations involving the safe destruction of dangerous materials and overseeing the repair of the machines that kept the company running. The unfortunate fate of BlackHull's operations have labeled Oshoth dead and forgotten. They would be unlikely to help even if they made it to this continent.
