## Features

Feature | Description
--- | ---
**Dark Vision**  |  60ft
**Shout, Command and Order** | As an action on your turn, you can shout sharp commands to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
**Pack Tactics** | You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
**Sunlight Sensitivity** | You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight
**Industry Authority** | As an ex-pit boss you're able to flex your commanding gaze and authority on industry workers. Gaining information from these workers and their unsavory contacts is easier, and industry bosses will turn a blind eye.
**Magical Tinkering**  |  At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have tinker's tools or other artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice: The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long. The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away. A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like. The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.
**Infuse Item**  |  At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items. **Infusions Known:** When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the "Artificer Infusions" section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one. **Infusing an Item:** Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see "Attunement" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one. You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new property applies.
**The Right Tool for the Job**  |  At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with tinker's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.
**Tool Expertise**  |  Starting at 6th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.
**Battle Smith Spells**  |  Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Smith Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.
**Battle Ready**  |  When you reach 3rd level, your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways: You gain proficiency with martial weapons. When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.
**Steel Defender**  |  By 3rd level, your tinkering has borne you a faithful companion, a steel defender. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the steel defender stat block. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics. In combat, the steel defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action. If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored. At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have your smith's tools with you. If you already have a steel defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.
**Extra Attack**  |  Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
**Flash of Genius** |  Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Infusions

**Infusions Known:** 6  
**Max Infused:** 3  

**Repeating Shot**  
Item: A simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement)  
This magic weapon grants a + 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it's used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it. If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.  

**Replicate Magic Item: Bag of Holding**  
This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.  
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.  
Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.


**Replicate Magic Item: Gloves of Thievery**  
These gloves are invisible while worn. While wearing them, you gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Sleight of Hand checks and Dexterity checks made to pick locks.  

**Enhanced Arcane Focus**  
Item: A rod, staff, or wand (requires attunement)  
While holding this item, a creature gains a + 1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores half cover when making a spell attack. The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.  

**Enhanced Defense**  
Item: A suit of armor or a shield  
A creature gains a + 1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item. The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

**Enhanced Weapon**  
Item: A simple or martial weapon  
This magic weapon grants a + 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

## Roleplaying

### Details

Oshoth is a muddy grey kobold with red highlights along the two horns framing striking red eyes and a constant sharp toothed smile. He has a small stature at 2' 3" and dresses in fine functional clothes with nary a spot on them. A curved copper pipe protrudes from his mouth constantly billowing multicoloured smoke.

**Background:** BlackHull Factory Boss (Professional Psychopath)  
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil  
**Eye Colour:** Red  
**Scale Colour:** Muddy Grey w/ Red highlights  
**Age:** 36  
**Height:** 2' 3"  
**Weight:** 28 lbs  
**Size:** Small  

### Personality Traits

Oshoth has a dangerous personality that is betrayed by his constant smile. He sounds deceptively cheerful at all times, hiding his anger well and showing no signs of outward annoyance. This belies his usually stewing anger that manifests while misleading people and acting contrary to his speech. He is a psychopath while under the effects of [Aether](Aether.md) and a monster when he is off the drug.

### Bonds

I will demolish those who stand in my way to power.

### Ideals

Quid Pro Quo is the way this world works, I'll barely lift a finger if the deal isn't fair.

### Flaws

I am a psychopath, and highly addicted to the substance known as [Aether](Aether.md)

### Backstory

Oshoth is an unsavory character, working his craft for those who pay his fees and keep his addictions going. Having been dragged into captivity at an early age into the mystical factories of the mysterious BlackHull Shipping Company to service the massive secret arcomechanical devices that make BlackHull a true naval powerhouse. The work was dangerous but still safer than the bosses and other workers, you were either fighting the machines innards or fighting the larger folk for food. No one escaped unscathed and Oshoth got caught out worst than most.  

The mind is a fragile thing and when wild magic catches you in it's grasp anything can happen. Something dark and ancient touched Oshoth's mind, giving him his name and warping his mind into something alien. Oshoth became mute in his state and would mechanically complete his tasks with dull unblinking eyes. He would tear out spare parts from machines and use them to build an alien construct. Soon he was exposed to Aether as he wandered into a cloud that concentrated in one of the machine ducts. Like a lightning strike, some of his former self broke through his broken mind. He knew what he needed and he followed the wisps floating through the ducts.

With mechanical motion he strode into the underbelly of the factory, stumbling on a makeshift Aether den. He walked in a daze, grabbing the first pipe he could reach from the ducts. Taking a deep breath and releasing a gout of multi coloured smoke, he smiled. A madman was brought into the world this day as his eyes closed and he gained clarity. It was his time to become something more.     

Oshoth learned alot while huddled in those massive machines, about the way the world worked and how to bend it to his will. His tools were his brushes and those machines his canvas, consistent exemplary work lead to his promotion from indentured servitude to pit boss. Despite his small size Oshoth gave those under his command a reason to fear him, constant productivity increases were expected and he would do anything to meet the quotas, even kill. His knowledge gained from the machines brought him the inspiration to make an arcomechanical ranged weapon that acted as a force multiplier for him and his guards.

Oshoth's newfound power brought him many things he never experienced, including the psychedelic magical drug Aether. Aether was made by empowering gems and powdering them with a thick sludge made from swamp peat and a benign poison and provided the user with many effects. Oshoth smoked the drug constantly through his long copper pipe for it heightened his ability to see the magic in the air and produced a sharp high that made you seem indestructible. It did far worse however and made Oshoth dependent on it, making him exhausted when it was taken away. The power was intoxicating for Oshoth, but nothing lasts forever.

A rebellion from the indentured servants caused severe damage to one of the arcane generators that powered the factories. This lead to a wild magic detonation of the plant that had a vast area of effect. The sundered city transformed into a chaotic wasteland of monsters and nonsense. Some would say Oshoth was lucky to have been teleported to another continent, but Oshoth thought otherwise as his race made him an outsider.

Work on the side plying his knowledge of magical machinery for unsavory types kept him functional while topping up his supply of Aether. His preferences always lead him in the wrong direction, but this next job might help turn things around.

### Allies + Organizations

BlackHull Shipping Company [Old]:  
Served as a Pit Boss for the Company. Worked operations involving the safe destruction of dangerous materials and overseeing the repair of the machines that kept the company running. The unfortunate fate of BlackHull's operations have labeled Oshoth dead and forgotten. They would be unlikely to help even if they made it to this continent.
